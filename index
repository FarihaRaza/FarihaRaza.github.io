    <p class="secondP">Let's start off by stating that cats are actually very nice animals. Now that maybe we have found a common ground, we can move on to admiring the world of coding. I enrolled in the GirlsWhoCode program in order to immerse myself even more into such new innvations and I believe I made a great decision! We are actually learning how to code; thankfully it's not block based anymore. For now, the class is learning how to code using HTML and I enjoy it very much. This is a wonderful experience.</p>
